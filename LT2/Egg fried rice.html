 <p> <b>Method</b></p>
          <p>
1. Start    cooking    the    rice    however    you    do,    and    put    some    oil    in    a    frying    pan.  
              </p>
          <p>
    
2. Chop    the    onion    into    bits,    any    size    really,    doesnt    matter    particularly    and    throw    
into    the    frying    pan.  
              </p>
          <p>
    
3. Chop    the    mushrooms    and    add    to    the    onions.    
              </p>
          <p>
    
4. Once    the    rice    is    cooked,    drain    it    off    and    add    it    into    the    frying    pan. 
              </p>
          <p>
    
5. Tip    the    drained    sweetcorn    into    the    pan    as    well    and    stir    it    all    up.  
              </p>
          <p>
    
6. Break    the    eggs    into    the    pan    (OR    beat    them    together    in    another    bowl    and    tip    
into    the    frying    pan)    and    stir    the    mixture    up. 
              </p>
          <p>
    
7. At    this    point,    you    need    to    keep    stirring    the    mixture,    keeping    the    eggs    moving.    
Keep    going    until    the    eggs    have    cooked,    should    take    about    5-­‐8    minutes    maybe?
